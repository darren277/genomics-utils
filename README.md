# Genomics Utilities

## Description

Right now this is just an assortment of scripts for parsing and understanding genetic code strings.

Some of the utility functions include:
* Run length encoding (and decoding) for string compression.
* Burrows-Wheeler Transform (and inverse) for string compression.
* Some codon, amino acid, and nucleotide parsing utilities.
* Use of a suffix tree (3rd party library) to search for substrings in a given string.
* Use of the same suffix tree libary to find the longest common substring between two strings.
